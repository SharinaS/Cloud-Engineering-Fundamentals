EMR = Elastic Map Reduce

Think **Data and EC2s**

> Amazon EMR launches clusters in minutes. You don’t need to worry about node provisioning, infrastructure setup, Hadoop configuration, or cluster tuning. Amazon EMR takes care of these tasks so you can focus on analysis.

Amazon EMR provides you a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances. You can access the operating system of these EC2 instances that were created by Amazon EMR.

Surprisingly, it's not a managed service.
