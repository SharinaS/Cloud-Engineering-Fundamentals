# Direct Connect

A direct connection from your data center into AWS, using **dedicated** lines. It is an AWS service. 

Allows for **private connectivity** between AWS and a datacenter, office, etc. 

Direct connect locations are spread all over the world. 

Within direct connect is a "AWS cage," which has routers. Customers routers then connect to the routers within the AWS cage. None of this traverses the internet. There is use of the AWS backbone network. 

## Use Cases

Useful for high throughput workloads (ie lots of network traffic). 

Useful for when you need a **stable and reliable and secure connection**. For example, if you have situation where you're trying to use a VPN connection but it keeps dropping out b/c of the amount of throughput, you can use a direct connect to solve those issues.

VPN connectivity utilizes the public Internet, which can have unpredictable performance and despite being encrypted, can present security concerns

## Steps for Direct Connect Setup

Note that if one does not have a direct connect connection at your location, one can't do these steps. 

1. Create a virtual interface in the Direct Connect console - this is a Public Virtual Interface.
2. Go to the VPC console > VPN connections. Create a Customer Gateway.
3. Create a Virtual Private Gateway
4. Attach the Virtual Private Gateway to the desired VPC.
5. Select VPN Connections and create new VPN Connection
6. Select the **Virtual Private Gateway and the Customer Gateway** (both of which make up a VPN connection)
7. Once the VPN is available, set up the VPN on the customer gateway or firewall.
