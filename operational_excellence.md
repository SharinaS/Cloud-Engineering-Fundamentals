# Operational Excellence

See the [Well-Architected Framework here](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf).

## Key AWS Services

### CloudFormation

The AWS service that is essential to Operational Excellence is AWS CloudFormation, which you can use to create templates based on best practices. This enables you to provision resources in an orderly and consistent fashion from your development
through production environments.

### Config, CloudWatch, ES

The following services and features support the
three areas in operational excellence:

* Prepare: AWS Config and AWS Config rules can be used to create standards for workloads and to determine if environments are compliant with those standards before being put into production.
* Operate: Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor the operational health of a workload.
* Evolve: Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) allows you to analyze your log data to gain actionable insights quickly and securely.
