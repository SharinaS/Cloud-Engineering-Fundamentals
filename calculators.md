# Calculators

A huge part of the Cloud Practitioner exam

Two types:

## Simple Monthly Calculator (hosted on S3)

* Lets you build out your own environment and helps you estimate the cost.
* Monthly cost
* A no-frills calculator, kinda reminiscent of if CraigsList had a calculator ....

## Total Cost of Ownership Calculator (TCO)

* Compares costs between if you do something on premises versus the cost of putting your business on AWS
* You versus AWS services
* AKA TCO calculator
* Pretty graphs and tables of values, with a report your can download (You could save 69% a year by moving infrastructure to AWS.... )
* Evaluates:
  * Server costs
  * Storage costs
  * Network costs
  * IT Labor costs

### Minimum Info Needed

The AWS TCO tool at minimum only needs to ask you about server and storage configuration details

* may be phrased as how many "on-premises virtual machines" there are.
