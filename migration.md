# Migration Hub

AWS Migration Hub provides a single location to **track the progress** of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions. 

Migration Hub is for tracking. In contrast, Application Discovery Service is for *planning application migration to the cloud*.

Using Migration Hub allows you to choose the AWS and partner migration tools that best fit your needs, while providing visibility into the status of migrations across your portfolio of applications. 

Migration Hub also provides key metrics and progress for individual applications, regardless of which tools are being used to migrate them. 

For example, you might use **AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, CloudEndure Migration**, and partner migration tools such as ATADATA ATAmotion or RiverMeadow Server Migration SaaS to migrate an application comprised of a database, virtualized web servers, and a bare metal server. 

Using Migration Hub, you can view the migration progress of all the resources in the application. This allows you to quickly get progress updates across all of your migrations, easily identify and troubleshoot any issues, and reduce the overall time and effort spent on your migration projects.

AWS Migration Hub provides a single place to monitor migrations in any AWS region where your migration tools are available. 

## Pricing

There is no additional cost for using Migration Hub. You only pay for the cost of the individual migration tools you use, and any resources being consumed on AWS.
