## Make a Bucket in S3 Using the Terminal
Make sure you have access to your EC2 instance via the terminal (for setting up an EC2 instance, [see my EC2.md file](https://github.com/SharinaS/Cloud-Engineering-Fundamentals/blob/master/EC2.md) - you'll be in a directory that looks like:  

```
[root@ip-111-11-11-11 ec2-user]#
```
### Make a bucket
The format is **aws console + the service + action + name of new thing**.

*Note that the name of the bucket must be lowercase.*
```
aws s3 mb s3://supercooldemobucket
```

### List all the buckets you have in S3:
```
aws s3 ls
```

### Upload Content
To upload content into the bucket from the current location:
(for example, you can make a demo txt file with some content in it using `echo "this is some cool content" > cool-file-name.txt`

... use `ls` to prove to yourself that the file now exists within the current directory)

```
aws s3 cp demoCCP_textfile.txt s3://supercooldemobucket
```
