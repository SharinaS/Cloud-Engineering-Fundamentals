# About S3
S3 is one of the oldest services in AWS. 

Simple Storage Service 
* Static files
* Not suitable for installing an OS on
* Not used for hosting a DB

S3 is a safe place to store files - object files / static files

Upon upload, an HTTP 200 code will come back to your browser is the upload is successful. 


### Object-Based Storage 
Object is made up of:
* Key - name of the object
* Value - the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
* Version ID - important for versioning
  * S3 allows for versioning!
* Metadata - data about data you're storing
* Subresources
  * Access control lists - the permissions of that object. You can lock each object down individually (versus bucket level)
  * Torrent

### File Size
File size can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB. 

### Universal Namespace
A universal namespace, so the names must be unique globally. This is because it is creating a web address. It will have the bucket name, region, amazonaws.com. It will create a DNS web name, in other words.

### Data Consistency
S3 has Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects, which means as soon as you upload the object, you're able to read it.

Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propogates), meaning it will take a bit to update or delete a file. Before the change propogates, you'll be reading the earlier version. 

#### Amazon Guarantees
Built for 99.99% availability, and guaranteed at 99.99% availability.

99.999999999999 (eleven 9's) guarantees durability, so if an object is put into S3, it will likely not be lost, in other words. 

### Lifecycle Management
You can specify that when an object is x days old, move that object to another bucket or glacier.

### Versions
You can have multiple versions within an S3 bucket

### Encryption
You can encyrpt the object at rest

### MFA Delete
You can turn on multi-factor authentication to delete an object, which means the object is protected so it isn't accidentally deleted.

### Access Control Lists & Bucket Policies
Allows for securing of data

## S3 Transfer Acceleration
File transfers occur very fast and securely.

CloudFront's Edge Locations are used to make this happen. When a user uploads a file, it uploads to an edge location, versus to the S3 bucket. Then, this goes over the Amazon backbone network, taking the contents directly back to where the bucket is located. This speeds up user's upload times. 


## Cross Region Replication
If you have a bucket in region 1, and you want to replicate the bucket in region 2 (for disaster recovery and high availability). Upon upload in region 1, and you have cross region replication turned on, the bucket in region 2 will appear. 

## Fees
* Storage - the more you store, the more you're billed - you pay by the gig
  * If you have a lot of objects, it incurs "Monitoring and Automation," which is per 1000 objects.
* Requests - more requests, the more the money
* Storage Management Pricing, so the tier you choose will determine the price
* Data Transfer Pricing
* Transfer Acceleration
* Cross Region Replication

# Tiered Storage
When in doubt, choose Intelligent Tiering.

## Storage Classes
All the following have a first byte latency (how quickly you can access your data) of milliseconds.

S3 Standard
* 99.99% availability and 99.99999999999% durability
* stored redundently in multiple facilities
* Can handle the loss of 2 facilities at the same time
* Most expensive, so it's good to avoid, unless you've got 1000s or millions of objects. Consider using Intelligent Tiering instead. 

S3 - IA
* IA = infrequently accessed 
* For data that does not need to be accessed all that often
* Less expensive than S3 Standard.

S3 One Zone - IA
* Storage in only one availability zone
* Infrequently accessed
* Takes the place of RRS, a service that is being phased out. RRS is like S3 One Zone, when you want something cheap and you don't care about accessing the data much.
* A good option if you don't want to use Intelligent Tiering / Standard.
* Good to choose if you don't care about redundancy, and want something cheaper than S3 Standard, and still want to frequently access the object.

S3 - Intellgient Tiering
* AI will analyze how often an object is accessed, and will automatically move data to the most cost-effective tier.
* No performance impact or operational overhead.
* A good tier to make use of.

## Glacier
For data archiving, ie, having to save data for 7 years legally.

S3 Glacier
* Costs the same or less than on-premise solutions
* Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours (first byte latency)

S3 Glacier Deep Archive
* Lowest cost of all storage classes.
* Retrieval time is 12 hours (so you won't get the data for half a day after submitting a request, which is its first byte latency)

# Security - Bucket Permissions and Management
By default, the buckets are private.

S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs, which keeps track of requirests made to the bucket. You can have those access logs sent to another bucket in the same or another account for storage. 

## Bucket Permissions
### Block Public Access
Lets you choose whether the bucket is blocked to all public access, which is the default, or open it up to various levels of public access. 

### Access Control List (ACL)
Allow you to set detailed permissions all the way down to individual objects. If there's a particular object in a particular bucket, you can block down to that object, ie a spreadsheet, that no one is allowed to view it except for Benedict Cumberbatch, who works in the entertainment department. 

Can use a bucket ACL or a bucket policy to control permissions.

### CORS configuration

## Encryption
Encryption in Transit - HTTPS - achieved with SSL, aka TLS.

If a person breaks into a server, grabs a harddisk drive, and tries to access it, the objects that are encrypted will not be able to be read (theoretically, I guess)... unless they have the AWS key.

### Type of Encryption
Server Side (Amazon)
* S3 Managed Key, aka SSE-S3 (Server side encryption S3)
* AWS Key Management Service, aka Managed Keys SSE-KMS (server side encryption with KMS)
* Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C

Cient Side 
* You encrypt the object and upload it to S3.

### How to Change Encryption in Console
* Go to the bucket, click on the object's radio button. 
* On the right, a blue titled box will appear. The section called "Properties" has a row called "Encryption."
* You can choose None, AES-256 or AWS-KMS
  * AES-256 is the S3 Managed Key
  * AWS-KMS allows you to use aws/s3 keys, or you can choose to use your own custom keys (custom KMS ARN).

# Versioning
Once enabled, you can't disable it, only suspended.

Integrates with lifecycle rules

Uses MFA, which prevents folks from deleting objects. 

## How To Add Versioning
* Create a bucket.
* Change the settings for the bucket so objects in the bucket can be public (this will make experimenting with the objects easier, since you'll be able to see their content).
* Go to properties and click on Versioning. Choose `Enable versioning`. 

![screenshot of enabling version control in S3](/assets/versioningenabled.png)

* Upload your first object, say a txt file with a little content, and make it public.
* Edit your txt file and re-upload. 
* Up above the object listed in the bucket, you'll see an option to `Hide` or `Show` Versions. Toggle it to say `Show`. You should now see two versions of the same object! 

![screenshot of S3 version option](/assets/s3versions.png)

* To view the newest version, you'll have to make it public, FYI. 

## Storage Consideration (= billing consideration)
When you are uploading new versions after editing files, note that each new version can be much larger than the last one. When architecting, keep this in mind, since if you expect to make many changes, you may find it's better to not upload every version, since storage requirements can exponentially increase within the bucket. 

## Deleting After Adding Versioning
To delete a version, the user must have MFA set-up, which provides an additional layer of security against accidental deletion.

To delete a particular version, click on that the radio button next to that version. To do this, make sure that the Versions toggle is set to `Show`.

When deleting the entire object, and you have Versions toggled to `Hide`, it will create a new version of that object that is of status deleted. You can un-delete the object by deleting that version, and it will restore that object to the prior version.

# Lifecycle Management
### About
When you add a lifecycle rule, it will automate transitioning your objects to different tiers of storage. When you specify it, it will take care of expiring the objects too. 

### How To
Go to S3. Go into a bucket that has versioning enabled. Click on the tab called "Management." You can then click on the button called "Lifecycle." 

Click the button "Add lifecycle rule," which will add a rule to the bucket.

![screenshot of lifecycle rule screen](/assets/lifecyclerule.png)

Can add tags when adding a rule name. Tags will make sure the rule only applies to those tags. If you want to apply the rule to the entire bucket, skip using tags.

Next, you specify whether to have the rule apply to current or past versions of the object in the bucket. 
* When you click on "Current version," you need to `+Add transition`. This will let you choose what tier to transition to after a certain number of time. 

![screenshot of lifecycle rules](/assets/lifecyclerules.png)

You can then "Configure expiration" for both current and previous versions. When you click on the radio button for "Clean up incomplete multipart uploads, this refers to uploads that occur in various pieces. Sometimes you can have files that don't upload correctly, so this will help clean those poorly loaded files from lingering.

# Make a Bucket in S3 Using the Terminal
Make sure you have access to your EC2 instance via the terminal (for setting up an EC2 instance, [see my EC2.md file](https://github.com/SharinaS/Cloud-Engineering-Fundamentals/blob/master/EC2.md) - you'll be in a directory that looks like:  

```
[root@ip-111-11-11-11 ec2-user]#
```
### Make a bucket
The format is **aws console + the service + action + name of new thing**.

*Note that the name of the bucket must be lowercase.*
```
aws s3 mb s3://supercooldemobucket
```

### List all the buckets you have in S3:
```
aws s3 ls
```

### Upload Content
To upload content into the bucket from the current location:
(for example, you can make a demo txt file with some content in it using `echo "this is some cool content" > cool-file-name.txt`

... use `ls` to prove to yourself that the file now exists within the current directory)

```
aws s3 cp demoCCP_textfile.txt s3://supercooldemobucket
```
