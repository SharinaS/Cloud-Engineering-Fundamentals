# About CloudWatch

A monitoring service for:

* AWS resources
* Applications run on AWS

> Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to **changes in your AWS resources**. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate. You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly. --*AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exam Course*

Cloudwatch monitors performance for:

* Compute
  * EC2 Instances
  * Autoscaling groups
  * Elastic load balancers
  * Route53 health checks
* Storage & Content Delivery
  * EBS Volumes
  * Storage Gateways
  * CloudFront

CloudWatch with EC2 will by default monitor events *every 5 minutes* 

* You can have 1 minute intervals by turning on *detailed monitoring*.

## EC2

Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically **stop, terminate, reboot, or recover** your EC2 instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions to help you save money when you no longer need an instance to be running. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs.

### Available Metrics

CloudWatch can monitor at a **host level**. This includes metrics such as:

* CPU utilization
* Network utilization
* Disk performance
* Disk Reads/Writes
* Status Check
  * hypervisor
  * EC2 instance

### Custom Metrics

To monitor other items you need to prepare a custom metric using a Perl or other shell script, as there are no ready to use metrics for these:

* memory usage
* disk swap utilization
* disk space utilization
* page file utilization
* log collection

### CloudWatch Agent

 there is a multi-platform *CloudWatch agent* which can be installed on both Linux and Windows-based instances. You can use a single agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. 

## Dashboards

In CloudWatch, you can create dashboards. A dashboard can be created to either show us our region, another region, or even the entire global overview. Essentially, a dashboard shows what is happening in the AWS environment. 

## Alarms

Lets you set alarms to notify you when particular thresholds (ie, billing, cpu usage) are hit.

## Logs

CloudWatch > Logs 

Allows for performance logging. So, you can send all your logs to CloudWatch. Allows for aggregation, monitoring and storing of logs.

## Events

CloudWatch Events deliver nearly a real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. This lets you respond to state changes.

## CloudTrail vs. CloudWatch

Don't get confused! AWS will try to trip you up on an exam about these two services.

CloudTrail records AWS Management Console actions and monitors API calls within the AWS platform.

* Leads to increase in visibility into your user and resource activity.
* Allows for identifying:
  * which users and accounts called AWS
  * source IP address from which the calls were made
  * when the calls were made

So, anytime you make an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket, CloudTrail is making notes. 

* "Who provisioned the EC2 instance?" <-- think CloudTrail

While CloudWatch is about *performance*, CloudTrail is about *auditing*.

* "What's the performance of the EC2 instance?" <-- think CloudWatch

# CloudWatch & Databases

## RDS 

you can use CloudWatch to monitor the CPU Utilization of your database instance, but it does not provide the percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database process in your RDS instance.

* Use RDS Enhanced Monitoring instead. See more in [the databases file](https://github.com/SharinaS/Cloud-Engineering-Fundamentals/blob/master/databases.md)

# Do Things with CloudWatch

### Make the instance with CloudWatch turned on:
Launch a new instance. Amazon Linux 2 AMI, t2.micro. 

In "Configure Instance Details," go down to "Monitoring." Click the radio button that says, "Enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring."
* Checks every minute.

Okay to use default for the "Add Storage" step.

Add some tags

Add to an existing security group - ... use a self-created security group (which has HTTP (source: 0.0.0.0/0), HTTP (::/0) and SSH (0.0.0.0/0) for inbound rules).

Launch. 

### Examine the new instance:
Under the monitoring tab, can see host-level metrics, like the CPU utilization, our disk, network and status checks. We can't see RAM utilization or how much disk storage space is left <-- to do that we need custom metrics, by the way. 

### Test it:
*Goal: Log into the EC2 instance and max out the CPU {evil laugh}.*

Set up an alert that tells us when the CPU utilization goes above a certain percentage:
* Make sure you know what your instance Id is. 
* Go into Management and Governance > CloudWatch
* Click on "Alarms" in the vertical nav bar. 
* Click the blue button, "Create new alarm" 
* Click the button in the middle of the grey square that says "Select metric"
* In the tab "All metrics" down below, click on "EC2," then "Per-Instance Metrics"
* Click the radio button of the InstanceID that is yours, with a "Metric Name" of "CPUUtilization," and click the blue button, "Select metric."
* Midway down the new window, you'll see "Alarm details." Give the alarm a name and a description. Set your CPUUtilization amount you want to be alerted about in "Whenever: CPUUtilization." 
  * The number you choose after giving it a conditional, is a percentage. Ie, >= 90%.
  * The "for 1 out of __ datapoints" means, "for 1 minute out of a minute, for CPUUtilization of greater than 90%, it will send an alarm. 
  * You can edit it to say alternatively other things, like "for 2 minutes out of 5," etc.
* Down scroll down to "Actions," and select who to send the notification to and click "Create Alarm."
  * Click "New list" and add an appropriate email address.

In CloudWatch Alarms, if it says "INSUFFICIENT_DATA," don't be alarmed, it is probably because you are not yet using your instance. 

Go to your EC2 instances, and copy the public IP address of the instance. 

SSH into the instance. After elevating privlages to root, write the following to put the ec2 instance into *an infinite loop* {mwahaha!}:

```
[root@ip-111-11-11-111 ec2-user]# while true; do echo; done
``` 
You'll see a bright blue flashy box... and then you'll get an emailed alarm! In CloudWatch you'll see ALARM is triggered and is bright red.
