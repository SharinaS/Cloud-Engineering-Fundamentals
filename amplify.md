## Projects

[GFTastyNoms is an Android App](https://github.com/SharinaS/GFTastyNoms) I'm working on to further explore Amplify, AWS and Android. The Readme has notes about the various AWS services used in the app.

[JavaTag, aka ZombieTag, is an Android App](https://github.com/SharinaS/JavaTag) built during a sprint cycle with a team of five other developers. It uses Amplify and various AWS services.

[Taskmaster is an Android app](https://github.com/SharinaS/taskmaster) I built as a learning project during my time at Code Fellows. It has a range of AWS services, integrated in with Amplify. FYI, it uses version 1.0 of Amplify, which is now out of date.
