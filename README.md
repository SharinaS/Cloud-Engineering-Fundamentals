# Cloud Engineering Fundamentals - AWS
A repository dedicated to the learning of cloud engineering, specifically AWS Services. This project started after earning my certificate in "Advanced Software Development in Java" at Code Fellows in Seattle, and as such also includes links to notes I took during that academic time period. 

Do note that a number of these technologies, such as Amplify, have changed versions since I did projects using them, so, check the docs carefully when applicable, and switch to the most up to date version. The amplify docs are a great example - some of my notes may still reference amplify 1.0; at the time of writing this, you actually want to make sure you link over to amplify 2.0 version of the docs, otherwise I can just about guarantee your project won't run properly (yes, that's experience talking, unfortunately). 

# Amplify 
You may find my notes on integrating Amplify with Android, along with a number of AWS services, Amplify and Android in my [Java Fundamentals wiki](https://github.com/SharinaS/java-fundamentals/wiki). Specific topics associated with Amplify and Android - with links to this wiki - are found below:
