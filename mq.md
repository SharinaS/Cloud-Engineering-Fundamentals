# MQ

If you're using messaging with **existing applications** and want to move your messaging service to the cloud quickly and easily, it is recommended that you consider Amazon MQ. 

It supports industry-standard APIs and protocols so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ **without rewriting the messaging code** in your applications.

SQS, in contrast, would make you likely rewrite your messaging code :( 

# Messaging Services

Amazon MQ, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS are messaging services that are suitable for anyone from startups to enterprises.
