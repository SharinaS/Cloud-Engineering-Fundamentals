# Cloud Computing Models

There are three Cloud Computing Models: 

* Infrastructure
* Platform
* Software

## Infrastructure as a Service 

IaaS

Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. 

Typically provides access to:

* networking features
* computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware)
* data storage space. 

IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the practice of delivering a full compute stack — including servers, storage, networking and operating software — as an abstract, virtualized construct.

Serves as a way to manage configurations, provisioning and deployments.

May include tools such as: 

* version control
* testing 
* CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous deployment).

## Platform as a Service 

PaaS 

Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually **hardware and operating systems**) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 

This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

## Software as a Service 

SaaS

Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
