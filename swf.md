SWF = Simple Work Flow

> A fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator service

Think of SWF if a question refers to human workers and a need to manage that work.

## About SWF

A way of coordinating work across distributed application components... or a way to coordinate work across multiple components of your application.

SWF is a way of coordinating both your applications as well with human beings / manual processes

Task coordination use cases:

* media processing
* web application backends
* busines process workflows
* analysis piopeslines

Tasks are invocations of various processing steps in an application, which are preformed by:

* executable code
* web service calls
* human actions
* scripts

A way of combining the digital environment with human beings.

In SWF, you've gotten a human element to factor into the design process. If there's any sort of manual process, you will be using SWF.

## SWF Actors

### Workflow Starters

An app that can initiate a workflow.

Ie, 

* an e-commere website following the placement of an order
* mobile app searching for bus times

### Deciders

This controls the flow of activity tasks in a workflow execution.

If something has finished / failed in a workflow, a Decider chooses what to do next.

### Activity Workers

These carry out the activity tasks

### SWF Domain

A collection of related workflows.
